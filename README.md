# telegram-bot
This is a simple telegram-bot with the goal of testing new stuff in python

## Commands
`!help` - show help information\
`!repete <String>` - simply repeats the message after the command\
`!wiki <String>` - searches for the string on wikipedia and returns the first paragraph as a message\
`!download <URL>` - download a youtube video and send to the user (keep in mind that at the moment it's only possible to upload files up to 50Mb using Telegram's API, so if the video is too long the quality will be reduced)
